//! The interesting subject is the *grandchild*. Killing a supervised Node server
//! is easy; the bug that strands users is the shell command it spawned, which
//! survives its parent and keeps holding a port or a file lock. So the fixture
//! here is deliberately two levels deep: the guarded child does nothing but run
//! another process, and it is that inner process whose death is asserted.
//!
//! Liveness is observed through a file the inner process appends to on a timer,
//! because a PID is not evidence — the number is reused, and a process can be a
//! zombie while its PID still resolves. A file that stops growing is evidence.
