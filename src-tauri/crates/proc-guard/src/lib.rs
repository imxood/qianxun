//! Spawn child processes whose entire tree is guaranteed to die with this process.
//!
//! Killing a parent does not kill its children on Windows, and a Unix child that
//! forks its own descendants outlives a plain `kill` on the direct child. A desktop
//! app that supervises a long-running Node server therefore leaks orphan processes
//! on every crash unless the OS is told to reclaim the tree. This crate wires up
//! that reclamation:
//!
//! - **Windows** — a Job Object carrying `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. The
//!   kernel terminates every process in the job once the last handle to it closes,
//!   which happens even when the parent dies to `TerminateProcess` and runs no
//!   cleanup code of its own.
//! - **Unix** — each child leads its own process group, so the whole group is
//!   reachable through `killpg`.
//!
//! On Windows children additionally start with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`. That gives the
//! child a console with no visible window, and grandchildren inherit it — so
//! command-line tools the supervised process spawns stay invisible as well.
